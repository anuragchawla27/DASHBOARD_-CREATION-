# DASHBOARD_CREATION

🚗 BMW Car Sales & Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing BMW car data from multiple years using Power BI to build an interactive and insight-driven dashboard.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle in CSV format and contains various features related to BMW cars, such as model details, pricing, mileage, year, fuel type, and other specifications.

The main objective of this project is to transform raw automotive data into meaningful business insights through interactive visualizations, filters, and comparisons.
